                former professional footballer who now works as a football ambassador.[2] He started his career in
                Brazil as a forward but spent most of his career as a left back and has been described as the "most
                offensive-minded left-back in the history of the game".[3] Carlos is also widely considered one of the
                best left backs in history, and was also known as a free kick specialist throughout his career—his
                bending shots have measured at over 105 miles per hour (169 km/h).

                Diego Armando Maradona (Spanish: [ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona]; 30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) was an
                Argentine professional football player and manager. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in
                the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century
                award.[3][4] Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small
                stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other
                players.
